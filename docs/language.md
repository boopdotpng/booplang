# how does the language look?

This language is intended to mimic the look of english as much as possible. The main goal is to remove the use of parenthesis, brackets, and other weird characters that you cant type without moving your fingers somewhere weird. 

## sample code 
This is some sample code that I hope to get running soon.

## basic.boop
This file is a progress indicator for how many features are implemented in the compiler. It will increase in complexity as the project grows. 

## other notes

1. There is no main function. The compiler will automatically define a main function. Nested functions will be put outside of main, like normal functions.
